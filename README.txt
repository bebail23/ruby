frog.rb - Original 
  This is a game made with Ruby2D that requires the player to move a frog from the bottom of the screen to the top as quickly as possible. 
  However, there are different types of obstacles to traverse in order to make this possible. Time will run until the frog 
  reaches the top of the screen, so the player must win in order for the game to finish. 
  The time will be compared to a leaderboard of previous players with the three lowest times.
